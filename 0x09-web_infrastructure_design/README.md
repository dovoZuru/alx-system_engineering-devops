# Web infrastructure design

In this project, I and Alice began to research web infrastructure
design. We both conducted research on different design principles,
whiteboarded diagrams of a developing web infrastructure, started with a
simple LAMP model and ended with a fully distributed, monitored, and secured
system.

Files in this project contain links to each respective whiteboard diagram.
